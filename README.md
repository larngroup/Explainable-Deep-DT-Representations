# XDTA : Explainable Deep Drug-Target Representations for Binding Affinity Prediction
<p align="justify"> We explore the reliability of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in the identification of important regions for binding, and the significance of the deep representations by providing explanations to the modelâ€™s decisions based on the identification of the input regions that contributed the most to the prediction. Furthermore, we propose an end-to-end deep learning architecture to predict binding affinity, where CNNs are exploited in their capacity to automatically surmise and extract discriminating deep representations from 1D sequential and structural data.</p>
